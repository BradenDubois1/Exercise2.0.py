# Braden DuBois 1/19/2021 At what size of a project should you start using version management software? Why?
# GitHub is a software useful for a few applications. When you have a project with multiple people working on the code at the same time or you want to add existing code to someone else’s code. If a project is something that needs to be accessed by many people at any given moment GitHub is an excellent program to use. I personally think you should start using version management software once more than one person begins to work on the project or when a project gets to the point upwards of around fifteen to twenty lines of code are running on the project. Version management is useful for larger projects because you can go back to previous versions of the code to see what works and what doesn’t. If you add a new function or change a section of the code and it doesn’t work out you can change the code back to the previous state so it works again and try a new section of code.
